    "# Rotten Tomatoes vs IMDb\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to compare the ratings of movies between two popular websites which have slightly different agendas, Rotten tomatoes and Imdb. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rotten tomatoes is a 'Review aggregation website' whose primary function is to rate movies and tv shows. Here professional critics review and rate the content, and the website produces an aggregation of that score which they call the tomatometer. Rotten tomatoes also presents another score, the audience score, which is an aggregate of audience ratings. Rotten tomatoes presents information on cast, personal biographies, plot summaries, ratings of critics and fans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imdb on the other hand is an online movie and tv show database (owned by Amazon). It has information on cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. Where as Rotten tomatoes is centered around critical reviews of a piece, Imdb is centered around being a database of everyone involved with the production of that piece. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see there is much overlap between the functions and features of the two websites. I had this impression that Rotten Tomatoes was more critical that Imdb, so I acquired two databases scraped from these two websites from kaggle and tried to answer the question. In this project I have explored just movies and not tv shows."
